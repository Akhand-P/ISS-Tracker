# ISS-Tracker
In this python Script we will keep track the current location of ISS(International Space Station) and then maps the location. We will write a script that will display the current location of ISS along with onboarded crew names.
It uses  two different APIs while displaying the latitude and longitude of the ISS as well as yours.
It takes the current location of ISS in the form of latitude and longitude and then locates that value onto the map. It takes the value from the website at very 5 sec and then updates the value of latitude and longitude and thus also moves the ISS icon on the world.
